![Kirby Forms](/docs/kirby-forms.png)

Kirby enables developers to effortlessly provide web3 and decentralized identity functionality into their applications. Like the real Kirby, the library gains powers based on the underlying implementation.

NOTE: this is EXTREMELY WIP at this point, mostly just to prove the concept of using iframes as a Web3 Provider. More details / features will be coming rapidly over the next couple of weeks.
